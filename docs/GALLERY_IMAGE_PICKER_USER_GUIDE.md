### Public Section Protection
**Public sections** (visible to website visitors) have strict safety controls:

- ‚úÖ **Allowed**: Approved + blurred content with proper blurred display
- ‚ùå **Blocked**: Pending, flagged, or rejected content
- ‚ùå **Blocked**: Content marked for paysite or private use only
- üö® **Server Enforcement**: Multiple validation layers prevent bypassing

### Private Section Flexibility  
**Private sections** (admin-only or member-only) allow broader content:

- ‚úÖ **Allowed**: All approved and blurred content
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warned**: Flagged or private content shows confirmation dialog
- ‚úÖ **Allowed**: Content for paysite or private use
- üìã **User Choice**: Admin decides what's appropriate

### Security Measures
