6. **‚úÖ API Integration**: All backend endpoints responding correctly

### What You Can Test Right Now:

#### 1. **Access the Dashboard**
Navigate to the admin panel ‚Üí "Blurred/Approved" section to see the new model-centric interface.

#### 2. **Model Card Interface**  
- View 4 model cards with profile placeholders
- See activity status indicators (all showing "inactive" due to no content)
- Check responsive design by resizing browser window

#### 3. **Search & Filter System**
- Use search bar to filter models by name
- Try different sort options (newest, oldest, violations, pending)
- Test filter categories (all, pending, violations, active)

#### 4. **Modal System**
- Click on any model card or "View Media" button
- Modal opens showing "No media found" (expected - no content uploaded yet)
- Test modal closing (ESC key, backdrop click, X button)

#### 5. **API Testing**
```bash
# Test model dashboard API directly
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/model-dashboard/models?limit=4"

# Test search functionality  
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/model-dashboard/models?search=Escort&limit=2"
