---

## üöÄ Setup & Testing

### 1. Ensure Phase 1 is Complete
Make sure you've already completed Phase 1 setup:
```bash
cd /Users/programmer/Projects/musenest
npm install
npm run migrate
npm run migrate-data
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Your Model Pages

#### Test Model Homepage
Visit your migrated models:
```bash
# If you have these models from RoseMastos:
http://localhost:3000/modelexample/
http://localhost:3000/escortmodel/  
http://localhost:3000/camgirl/
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Page loads with your model's theme (glamour/basic)
- ‚úÖ Model name displays in hero section
- ‚úÖ Site settings (tagline, contact info) appear
- ‚úÖ Gallery images show if available
- ‚úÖ Testimonials display if available
- ‚úÖ Navigation menu works

#### Test Page Routes
Try different page types:
```bash
# FAQ Page (should show your migrated FAQ items)
http://localhost:3000/escortmodel/faq

# Gallery Page (should show all gallery sections)
http://localhost:3000/escortmodel/gallery

# About Page (if you have about content)
http://localhost:3000/escortmodel/about

# Contact Page
http://localhost:3000/escortmodel/contact

# Rates Page (if you have services data)
http://localhost:3000/escortmodel/rates
```

### 4. Test Theme Switching

#### Change Model Theme via API
```bash
# First, get a JWT token by logging in
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your_email@example.com",
    "password": "your_password"
  }'

# Get available themes
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/models/escortmodel/themes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Apply glamour theme (theme_id: 3)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/models/escortmodel/theme \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"theme_id": 3}'

# Apply basic theme (theme_id: 1)  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/models/escortmodel/theme \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"theme_id": 1}'
```

After changing themes, refresh the page to see the new design!

# - Template syntax errors
```

### No Data Showing
```bash
# Verify data migration worked
mysql -u root -p musenest -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gallery_images;"
mysql -u root -p musenest -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM faq_items;"
mysql -u root -p musenest -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM testimonials;"

# Check model exists and is active
mysql -u root -p musenest -e "SELECT id, name, slug, status FROM models;"
```

### Theme Not Applied
```bash
# Check model has theme assigned
mysql -u root -p musenest -e "
SELECT m.name, t.name as theme, mt.is_active 
FROM models m 
LEFT JOIN model_themes mt ON m.id = mt.model_id 
LEFT JOIN themes t ON mt.theme_id = t.id 
WHERE mt.is_active = true;
"

# If no theme, assign basic theme (id: 1)
# Use the API to set a theme
```

### Images Not Loading
```bash
# Check uploads directory exists
ls -la /Users/programmer/Projects/musenest/public/uploads/

# Check image paths in database
mysql -u root -p musenest -e "SELECT filename FROM gallery_images LIMIT 5;"

# Copy images from RoseMastos if needed
cp -r /Users/programmer/Projects/rosemastos/app/static/images/* /Users/programmer/Projects/musenest/public/uploads/
```
