# MuseNest Rates Page Redesign Plan

## Project Overview
Redesign the MuseNest rates page to match the comprehensive layout and functionality from RoseMastos, creating a professional two-column Incall/Outcall design with extended engagements and detailed information sections.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Database has comprehensive rates structure (`model_rates`, `model_rates_page_content`)
- ✅ Supports Incall/Outcall/Extended categories with existing data
- ✅ Current MuseNest page is generic with placeholder content
- ❌ Missing detailed pricing tables like RoseMastos
- ❌ No two-column Incall/Outcall layout

## Target Design Structure

### 1. Hero Section
- [x] "Rates & Donations" title
- [x] Professional subtitle about companionship/time investment
- **Status**: Keep current implementation

### 2. Main Rates Section (NEW - Two-Column Layout)
```
┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│     INCALL         │      OUTCALL        │
│   (Blue Header)    │   (Beige Header)    │
