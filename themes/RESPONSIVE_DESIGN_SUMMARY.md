Or manually:

1. Copy `themes/shared/responsive-universal.css` to your theme's assets folder
2. Rename it to match your theme name (e.g., `mytheme-responsive.css`)
3. Add this line before `</head>` in your layout:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/themes/mytheme/assets/mytheme-responsive.css">
```
